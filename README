This lists the history of grants given by TPF (The Perl Foundation). This
contains information on what grants were given (ordered by year), to whom they
were granted, for what project and what were the resulting outcome.

Each grant has the following information:
* "grantee": the person(s) to whom the grant was given
* "amount": grant amount
* "abstract": A short description of the grant
* "began": when the grant began
* "ended": when the grant ended
* "result": was the grant successful or not
* "comments": optional commentary on the grant or grant conditions

Some ordering rules:
* Grants are listed by the year they started
* Beginning dates refer to when the grant started
* Ending date refers to when TPF decided the grant was done, not when the grantee decided it will be done
