  Information on this grant is hazy.  There were some records (reflected in
  earlier versions of this document) that showed two $2000 grants, but this
  document now reflects the official TPF announcement of the grant, picked
  up from http://www.perlfoundation.org/2003_grants_third_quarter

  Discussion with #parrot seemed to indicate that this grant was not completed.
